        During this bootcamp, I hope to improve my problem-solving skills. I
        will actively seek out difficult issues and tasks that will push my
        talents and require me to think creatively. In addition, I will seek
        feedback on my problem-solving strategy from professors and classmates
        in order to find areas for growth.
