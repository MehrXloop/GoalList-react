      <h2>Develop strong debugging skills</h2>
      <p>During this bootcamp, I want to focus on developing excellent debugging abilities. Debugging is a necessary skill for each developer, and I will concentrate on knowing various debugging approaches, tools, and tactics. I want to practice debugging real-world problems and errors that happen during the development process, as well as solicit feedback from professors and peers to discover areas for growth. I will be able to effectively detect and repair issues in my code at the end of the bootcamp, making me a more knowledgeable and efficient developer.</p>
